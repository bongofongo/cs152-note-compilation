# cs152-note-compilation
A compilation of the notes I took during class in cs152 in autumn 2022 at UChicago. The class was on C.

I used Vim and vimtex to write these LATEX documents. UltiSnips was vital in quick writing of the notes. 
For example, a keystroke I used was to type "bpcode + <TAB>" to generate the boilerplate header info at the
top of my tex doc. I use Skim with vimtex to generate a pdf file and recompile it at each write in the tex doc. 
The key packages that might be more unique to this tex document are the listing and framed packages. 

All of these notes were written during the 50 minute classes and I wrote separate pdf files for each day. 
I got more explorative during the latter sections of the notes where I include more diagrams which I sketched up 
quickly in Illustrator. I compiled all the notes together at the end of the quarter to study for the final and
included a table of contents for easy access.
