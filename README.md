# cs152-note-compilation
A compilation of the notes I took during class in cs152 in autumn 2022 at UChicago. The class was on C.

The workflow for writing these in class is basically using UltiSnips in a Vim editor. 
The framed and listings packages were probably the most unique packages that were vital for the notes.
Every class I wrote one tex document and then compiled separate pdf files. At the end of the quarter I 
just merged them all together into this document and added a table of contents.
